function seaexplorer_options = configDTFileOptionsSeaExplorer()
%CONFIGDTFILEOPTIONSSEAEXPLORER  Configure loading options for SeaExplorer files in delayed time.
%
%  Syntax:
%    SEAEXPLORER_OPTIONS = CONFIGDTFILEOPTIONSSEAEXPLORER()
%
%  Description:
%    SEAEXPLORER_OPTIONS = CONFIGDTFILEOPTIONSSEAEXPLORER() should return
%    a struct with the parameters that control which are the deployment files,
%    whether they need to be converted, and which files and data should be used
%    in delayed time mode. The returned struct should have the following fields:
%      GLI_NAME_PATTERN: string with the name pattern of SeaExplorer glider
%        files to be loaded by LOADSEAEXPLORERDATA for processing.
%      PLD_NAME_PATTERN: string with the name pattern of SeaExplorer payload
%        files to be loaded by LOADSEAEXPLORERDATA for processing.
%      GLI_TIME: string with the name of the variable to use as timestamp
%        in glider files when combining data from a set of SeaExplorer files.
%      PLD_TIME: string with the name of the variable to use as timestamp
%        in payload files when combining data from a set of SeaExplorer files.
%      VARIABLES: string cell array with the name of the variables to load
%        from glider and payload files by LOADSEAEXPLORERDATA. Restricting
%        the list of variables to load may reduce the memory footprint.
