function [eastward, northward] = sgcur2cart(speed, direction)
%SGCUR2CART  Transform Seaglider water velocity speed and direction estimates to eastward and northward components. 
%
%  Syntax:
%    [EASTWARD, NORTHWARD] = SGCUR2CART(SPEED, DIRECTION)
%
%  Description:
%    [EASTWARD, NORTHWARD] = SGCUR2CART(SPEED, DIRECTION) computes the eastward
%    and northward components of the sea water velocity (m s-1) from magnitude
%    and direction estimates in SPEED (m s-1) and DIRECTION (degrees)
%    provided by Seaglider gliders. All arguments are the same size.
%
%  Notes:
%    This is just a convenience function to give a name to the conversion.
%    It is a shortcut to the built-in polar to cartesian conversion, POL2CART,
%    with needed angular unit conversion and order shift of output arguments.
%
%  Examples:
%    [eastward, northward] = sgcur2cart(speed, direction)
