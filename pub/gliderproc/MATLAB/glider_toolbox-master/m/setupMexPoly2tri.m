function setupMexPoly2tri()
%SETUPMEXPOLY2TRI  Build mex file for polygon triangulation function POLY2TRI.
%
%  Syntax:
%    SETUPMEXPOLY2TRI()
%
%  Description:
%    SETUPMEXPOLY2TRI() builds a mex file implementing the function POLY2TRI,
%    that performs polygon triangulation based on the General Polygon Clipper 
%    library (GPC). GPC should be installed from the non-free section of the 
%    official repositories on Debian based distributions, in which case the mex
%    file is built using the following attributes:
%      TARGET:
%        /path/to/poly2tri.mex(a64)
%      SOURCES:
%        /path/to/poly2tri.c
%      INCLUDES:
%        none
%      LIBRARIES:
%        -l gpcl
%    Alternatively, it is possible to build the mex file using the GPC sources 
%    directly. This is useful on systems that do not distribute the GPC library,
%    or to use a version of GPC different from the one installed in the system.
%    The GPC sources should be downloaded from the official web site and 
%    extracted to a directory called 'gpcl' in the same directory than the mex
%    file source:
%      TARGET:
%        /path/to/poly2tri.mex(a64)
%      SOURCES:
%        /path/to/poly2tri.c /path/to/gpcl/gpc.c
%      INCLUDES:
%        /path/to/gpcl/gpc.h
%      LIBRARIES:
%        none
%    Please note that when using this build rule, mex file and library sources
%    are compiled together. Hence the resulting binary might be slightly bigger.
%
%  Notes:
%    GPC is a library developed by Alan Murta at the University of Manchester,
%    freely available for non-profit use:
%      <http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~amurta/software/index.html#gpc>
%
%    On Debian based systems, GPC library may be installed from the non-free
%    section of the official repositories running the following command as root:
%      apt-get install libgpcl-dev
%
%    This function uses the function MEX to build the target. On GNU/Linux 
%    systems, the build process might fail after a warning if the compiler 
%    version is newer than the latest version supported by MATLAB, even though
%    running the same MEX command on a system shell builds the target properly.
%    The reason is that MATLAB may extent or overwrite the environment variable
%    LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to its own version of the standard libraries,
%    causing an incompatibility with the version of the compiler.
%    To solve the problem, either build the target from the shell or temporarily
%    overwrite the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH from the MATLAB session.

%  Examples:
%    % Check that GPC development files are installed on your system,
%    % or that GPC sources are present in the directory private/gpcl
%    setupMexPoly2tri()
%
%    % Incompatible versions of system compiler and libraries shipped with the
%    % the interpreter may cause build failure.
%    % Try to build the target against system libraries instead of shipped ones.
%    ld_library_path = getenv('LD_LIBRARY_PATH')
%    setenv('LD_LIBRARY_PATH')
%    setupMexPoly2tri()
%    setenv('LD_LIBRARY_PATH', ld_library_path)
