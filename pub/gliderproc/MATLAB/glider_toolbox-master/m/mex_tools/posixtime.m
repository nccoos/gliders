function t = posixtime()
%POSIXTIME  Current POSIX time using low level utilities.
%
%  Syntax:
%    T = POSIXTIME()
%
%  Description:
%    T = POSIXTIME() returns the current POSIX time: the number of seconds since
%    1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, not counting the effects of leap seconds.
%
%  Notes:
%    This function provides a compatibility interface for MATLAB and Octave,
%    computing the POSIX time using lower level tools available in each system:
%    In Octave, through the built-in interface to the ANSI C function TIME.    
%    In MATLAB, through a mex file interface to the ANSI C function TIME.
%
%  Examples:
%    t = posixtime()
%    datestr(posixtime2utc(t))
%    datestr(now())
%

%    POSIXTIME2UTC
