This folder contains drivers for L0-to-L1 processing for CTD, ECO, and Optode (DO) for both LongBay_2012 and SECOORA_2016. A similar set will be built for PEACH.

The output is a L1 mat file, which is stored in this folder. Note that a saved set of good mat files should be kept in a different folder.

The file timeBases.mat is a temporary file.
